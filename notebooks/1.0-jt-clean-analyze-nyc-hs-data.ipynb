    "The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test that high school seniors in the U.S. take every year.  Colleges use the SAT to determine which students to admit.  High average SAT scores are usually indicative of a good school.  \n",
    "\n",
    "New York City has published data on [student SAT scores](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) by high school, along with additional related data sets:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* SAT scores by school - SAT scores for each high school in New York City  \n",
    "* High school directory - Various descriptive information for each high school in New York City (i.e. geographic coordinates)  \n",
    "* Class size - Information on class size for each school  \n",
    "* AP test results - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)  \n",
    "* Graduation outcomes - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information  \n",
    "* Demographics - Demographic information for each school  \n",
    "* School survey - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school  \n",
    "\n",
    "New York City has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test.  For example, if certain racial groups consistently perform better on the SAT, we would have some evidence that the SAT is unfair.  \n",
