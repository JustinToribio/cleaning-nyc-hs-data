    "# Is the SAT unfair?  Cleaning NYC high school data to start finding the answer  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal of this project\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to clean and consolidate several datasets relating to the SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) and NYC (New York City) high schools.  The final cleaned dataset will be used in separate projects to explore if the SAT is unfair to particular groups of students.  The annual SAT is used by U.S. colleges and universities to determine which students to admit into their programs.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by exploring each of the datasets to understand the information they contain and how they can be consolidated.  We will then clean the datasets to make them ready for further analysis and modeling (i.e. correcting data types and errors, removing unnecessary characters and columns, filling in missing values etc...).  Finally, we will consolidate all of the data into a single cleaned dataset and export it to a csv (comma separated value) file that is ready to use for further exploratory data analysis, visualization and predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of results\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data consists of 8 separate datasets containing missing values, incorrect data types, data errors, unnecessary columns and a combined total of 65,875 rows and 3,861 columns.  The final result of this project is a single consolidated csv file containing 362 rows and 79 columns.  This final dataset is clean, consistent, relevant and ready to use for further analysis and modeling to explore the fairness of the SAT."

    "#  Introduction to the data\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City has published data on student SAT scores by high school, along with additional related datasets, which can all be found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?category=Education).  The following is a list of the datasets we will be cleaning and consolidating along with a brief description of each.  Each one links to the source page where the data can be downloaded:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **[SAT scores by school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4)**  (`\"sat_results.csv\"`):  NYC SAT results by school for the graduating seniors of 2012.  At the time of this writing, this was the most recent SAT data available.\n",
    "* **[High school directory](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2014-2015-DOE-High-School-Directory/n3p6-zve2)** (`\"hs_directory.csv\"`): Various descriptive information for each high school in NYC for the school year 2014-2015.  We are using this school year because it is the earliest this data was provided in csv format.  We are assuming the descriptive information for most schools (i.e. location) will not have changed much in just a few years.\n",
    "* **[Class size](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3)** (`\"class_size.csv\"`): NYC average class sizes by school for 2010-2011.  We are using this school year because this data was not provided \"by school\" for 2011-2012.\n",
    "* **[AP test results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-AP-Results/9ct9-prf9)** (`\"ap_results.csv\"`): NYC AP (Advanced Placement) exam results for 2012.  Passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject.  \n",
    "* **[Graduation outcomes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2005-2010-Graduation-Outcomes-School-Level/vh2h-md7a)** (`\"graduation.csv\"`): Various NYC graduation data for graduating classes 2005-2010.  These were the latest graduating years this data was available for.\n",
    "* **[Demographics](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2006-2012-School-Demographics-and-Accountability-S/ihfw-zy9j)** (`\"demographics.csv\"`): 2006-2012 NYC public school student populations by grade, special programs, ethnicity, gender etc...  \n",
    "* **[School survey](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8)** (`\"survey_all.txt\"`, `\"survey_d75.txt\"`): 2011 parent, teacher and student survey results for each school.  Survey questions assess each group's opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, safety and respect etc...  We are using the 2011 data because it was not available for 2012.\n",

We will fill in the missing data in `\"numeric_df\"` using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm with K=5.  We will then re-join `\"object_df\"` with the completely filled numeric data and re-assign the resulting dataframe back to `\"combined\"`.  \n",

We explored each of the datasets to understand them better and then cleaned them by correcting data errors, removing unnecessary columns, converting data types and filling in missing values.  The final result of this project is a single consolidated csv file containing 362 rows and 79 columns.  This final dataset is clean, consistent, relevant and ready to use for further analysis and modeling to explore the fairness of the SAT.  \n",
